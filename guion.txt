Deckard is looking at Batty:


			Batty is partly crumpled, frozen in an unnatural position 
			as though he had been writhing and stopped midwrithe.
			He looks back at Deckard with eyes full of
			life and intensity.


..............................................................

		They stare at each other for a long time in silence,
		communicating something with their eyes... without
		expression.  Finally Batty breaks the silence.
                        BATTY
          I've seen things...
                 (long pause)
          seen things you little people
          wouldn't believe... Attack ships
          on fire off the shoulder of Orion
          bright as magnesium... I rode on
          the back decks of a blinker and
          watched c-beams glitter in the dark
          near the Tanhauser Gate.
                 (not so long pause)
          all those moments... they'll be gone.

                  --  BATTY ---

			Batty is crumpled in a different position.  It's light-
			er now and Batty's eyes are staring into infinity...
			almost lifelessly.  A pigeon flutters down and perches
			on his shoulder.  Batty doesn't stir.

                        DECKARD (V.O.)
      I watched him die all night.  It
      was a long, slow thing and he
      fought it all the way.  He never
      whimpered and he never quit.  He
      took all the time he had... as
      though he loved life very much...
      every second of it... even the
      pain.  Then he was dead.


			Lo vi muriendo toda la noche. Fué una larga y lenta cosa y el
			lucho en todo los sentidos. EL nunca hizo muecas y nunca se rindió.
			El tomó todo el tiempo que tenia . . . Como lo habia pensado, el quiso
			mucho la vida , cada segundo, incluso el dolor.
			Después el estaba muerto.
